Hi ðŸ‘‹ Im ibidi. 25 y/o full stack developer from <img width="20" height="20" align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ff547ZT.png"> **TÃ¼rkiye**.

I design, develop and deliver useful, fast, and clean products. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on growing my own ideas and contributing to digital ecosystems that actually matter.

My core stack includes Vue, React, PHP, Liquid, CSS, and HTML â€” I like building things that scale and feel seamless for real users. Whether itâ€™s frontend magic or backend logic, I enjoy being in full control of the experience.

Outside of coding, I love learning how things work â€” not just technically, but strategically. From user journeys to product-market fit, I'm always exploring how tech meets people. I sometimes work with early-stage projects, helping refine both product and vision.

**A note about the web**

Web development today isnâ€™t just about visuals â€” itâ€™s about making digital experiences faster, more secure, and more human. The web feels like home to me â€” and Iâ€™m here to keep building it better, layer by layer.
